This is the README file ($Revision: 1.10 $) for Term::Query.pm.

Term::Query.pm is a Perl 5 module, which performs generalized queries on
various kinds of values.  Validation and normalization of input, based
on the type, is automated, as is error reporting and re-solicitation of
input.

Input of '?', unless configured otherwise, provides useful, helpful
information, based on the expected input type, even in the absence of a
programmer-supplied help string.

There is one primary subroutine, called "query", which is passed a
prompt and some "flags", optionally followed by addtional arguments,
depending upon the particular flags.

The flags are single characters which indicate:

    * input type: integer, real, string, yes-no, keyword, or
      non-keyword;

    * default input, in the absence of user input;

    * help string, to be reported for errors or input of '?';

    * input validation, such as regexp matching, maximum length, and
      "check" subroutine calls;

    * input handling, such as blank squeezing, and "before" subroutine
      calls.

    * name of the variable to be set with the validated input.

An accompanying subroutine, query_table, can be passed an array of of
arguments which will be interatively passed to query, allowing for easy
generation of table-driven query-response input routines.

The subroutine query_table_set_defaults can be used on a query table
array to cause any mentioned variables to be initialized with any
mentioned default values.  This is handy for having a single table
defining variables, their default values, and the validation criteria
for setting new values.

The subroutine query_table_process can be used on a query table array to
process the array in a complete general fashion.

Complete details are provided within the module, in the Perl 5 "pod"
format.  Traditional man pages are available with the command:

    pod2man Query.pm | nroff -man -

The code was developed and requires Perl5.001m (eg: it uses references),
Carp.pm (it diagnoses some misuse of itself) and the PrintArray.pm 
module (by the same author).

There is a Makefile with several useful targets for installing at one or
more common locations; there is a "test" target which will perform
regression tests against previous "good" output (see the "t" directory).

Version 2, and is located at:

  ftp://hub.ucsb.edu/pub/prog/perl/Term-Query-$VER.shar
  ftp://hub.ucsb.edu/pub/prog/perl/Term-Query-$VER.tar.gz

where $VER is the latest version number.  The ".shar" suffix indicates
a "shell archive"; the ".tar.gz" suffix indicates a "gzip" compressed
"tar" archive.

Suggestions or improvements are welcome.
